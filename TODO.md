json
Copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },

    "jest": "^27.0.0"
  }
}
 1.7 Install Global Dependencies

 1.7.1 On Mac/Linux, run:

 1.7.2 For Windows, install WSL and run the above command in an Ubuntu terminal.
Phase 2: Token Design, Tokenomics, and Smart Contract Development
 2.1 Define Token Purpose

 2.1.1 Document the purpose of SOLA (multi-faceted token with staking, rewards, and advanced tokenomics).
 2.2 Choose SPL Token Standard

 2.2.1 Decide between the standard SPL Token and Token‑2022 program.
For our purposes, we’re using Token‑2022 to integrate advanced tokenomics features (e.g., built‑in fees, configurable transfer hooks, interest accrual, non‑transferability, etc.).
 2.2.2 Review Token‑2022 documentation: Token‑2022 Docs.
 2.3 Smart Contract Creation

 2.3.1 Write a smart contract (using Anchor) that interacts with the Token‑2022 program.
 2.3.2 Create a dedicated smart contract (or program wrapper) that implements additional functionality for tokenomics and certification purposes.
 2.3.3 Integrate custom logic for advanced tokenomics as required by your design.
 2.4 Tokenomics Design & Integration (Token‑2022 Specific)

 2.4.1 Plan distribution strategies (airdrops, staking, liquidity mining).
 2.4.2 Set fixed supply: 2,900,000,000 SOLA.
 2.4.3 Define token utility (governance, payments, etc.).
 2.4.4 Incorporate Token‑2022 extensions to support your tokenomics:
 Custom Transfer Hooks
 Transfer Fee Configuration
 Optional features like non-transferability or interest-bearing logic
 2.4.5 Update token metadata to include additional on-chain data if needed (consider using the Metadata extension of Token‑2022).
 2.5 Decimals and Token Parameters

 2.5.1 Determine number of decimal places (0–9 range).
 2.5.2 Consider impact on transaction precision and user experience.
 2.6 Minting Function and Repartition

 2.6.1 Implement a function to mint tokens according to the following repartition:
mathematica
Copy
Percent | Category                           | Total tokens in M
------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------
18      | Future-focused Coding & Design     | 522
15      | E-Marketing                        | 435
15      | Staking Pools                      | 435
15      | Presale                            | 435
10      | Active Sovereigns Rewards          | 290
10      | Liquidity Pool & Listing Exchanges | 290
10      | Future Initiatives Funds           | 290
5       | Genesis Team (Locked Until 2028)     | 145
2       | Strategic Partnerships             | 58
 2.6.2 Ensure no single wallet holds more than 5% of tokens (use multiple wallets for each team/category).
 2.7 Token Metadata

 2.7.1 Incorporate token metadata: Name (Solaverse), Symbol (SOLA).
 2.7.2 Add Image URI and extended metadata via Token‑2022 extensions if applicable.
 2.8 Certification and Audit Preparation

 2.8.1 Document all tokenomics logic and smart contract architecture for external audit (e.g., Certik).
 2.8.2 Ensure integration with Token‑2022 extensions is thoroughly commented and has test coverage.
 2.8.3 Prepare a verifiable build (e.g., using anchor build --verifiable) to aid in audit reviews.
Phase 4: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment
 4.1 Smart Contract Testing

 4.1.1 Thoroughly test the smart contract on Solana's testnet/devnet.
 4.1.2 Write Jest tests to validate token behavior, including advanced Token‑2022 functionality.
 4.2 Logging & Bug Troubleshooting

 4.2.1 When encountering issues, reflect on at least 5–7 potential sources (e.g., incorrect extension initialization, insufficient rent-exempt balances, mismatched decimals, configuration errors, network connectivity issues).
 4.2.2 Distill those down to the 1–2 most likely sources and add detailed logs in your contract and test scripts to validate your assumptions.
 4.2.3 Update the backlog file to track bugs, fixes, and testing outcomes.
 4.3 Deployment Script for Devnet

 4.3.1 Create a deploy script that deploys the token using the Token‑2022 program on devnet.
 4.3.2 In the deploy script, change the token name and description (for devnet only) to differentiate from production.
 4.3.3 Test the deploy script and validate mint, account creation, and token transfers.
 4.4 Backlog & Progress Tracking

 4.4.1 Maintain a separate progress file or section in your repository that lists “Done” items and outstanding backlog tasks.
 4.4.2 Update the list with each completed task and note any issues encountered and their resolutions.
Phase 5: Integration and Personalization
 5.1 Ecosystem Integration
 5.1.1 Integrate the token with popular Solana wallets.
 5.1.2 Integrate the token with exchanges and platforms.
 5.2 Token Personalization
 5.2.1 Add description for the SPL token.
 5.2.2 Upload a token logo image.
 5.3 Multisig Consideration
 5.3.1 Explore the use of multi-signature wallets for enhanced security.
 5.3.2 Implement multisig for the mint authority.
 5.4 Update Metadata
 5.4.1 Update token metadata (name, description, image) if necessary post-deployment.
Phase 6: Community, Support, and Audit
 6.1 Solana Developer Community
 6.1.1 Engage with other developers on the Solana Discord and forums.
 6.1.2 Use community feedback to improve tokenomics and smart contract design.
 6.2 Documentation and External Resources
 6.2.1 Use docs.solana.com and spl.solana.com/token-2022 as references.
 6.3 Certification and External Audit
 6.3.1 Prepare all documentation and a verifiable build package to submit for external audit (e.g., Certik).
 6.3.2 Incorporate auditor feedback and update your contracts as needed.
Additional Instructions for Troubleshooting & Version Control
Bug/Issue Debugging:
When a bug or issue occurs, perform the following:

List 5–7 possible sources: (e.g., configuration errors, version mismatches, incorrect extension parameters, rent-exemption miscalculations, network latency issues, deployment script errors, or integration mismatches).
Narrow down: Identify the top 1–2 most likely causes.
Add logs: Insert logging into your smart contract (or use off-chain logging in your tests) to validate your assumptions before implementing fixes.
Always Check for Latest Package Versions:
Since we are in February 2025, make sure to run:

bash
Copy
npm update
and check the official Solana repositories for any new updates.

Backlog and Progress:
Maintain a separate progress.md file (or a similar tracker) in your repository to list:

Tasks marked as “done”
Any issues encountered with their corresponding logs and resolutions
Next steps and backlog items
