### In Progress
- Setting up metadata integration
- Implementing token personalization
- Integrating with Solana ecosystem tools

### Next Steps (Phase 4 & 5)
1. Metadata Integration:
   ```bash
   # Add metadata for the token
   npm run deploy:metadata
   ```
   - Add token logo
   - Update token description
   - Add external URL and other metadata

2. Token Personalization:
   - Implement transfer fee configuration
   - Set up transfer hooks
   - Configure metadata pointer

3. Ecosystem Integration:
   - Integrate with Solana wallets
   - Add to token lists
   - Set up liquidity pools

4. Security Measures:
   - Implement multisig for critical operations
   - Set up monitoring system
   - Configure security parameters

5. Testing & Verification:
   - Complete integration tests
   - Verify all token features
   - Test transfer hooks
   - Validate fee configuration

### Pending Actions
- Complete metadata integration
- Set up monitoring system
- Implement security measures
- Add monitoring and analytics
- Prepare for mainnet deployment

### Issues & Resolutions
1. Package compatibility:
   - Issue: @solana/spl-token-2022 package not found
   - Resolution: Updated implementation to use Token-2022 features from @solana/spl-token package

2. Keypair generation:
   - Issue: Base58 character restrictions for custom prefix
   - Resolution: Modified prefix to use 'So' instead of 'sola'

3. Token Distribution:
   - Issue: Transaction signing error in distribution
   - Resolution: Fixed transaction signing by using correct transaction object
